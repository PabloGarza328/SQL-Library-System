# SQL database for Library -- OSU Database Course Project #


## Overview ##
The Good Place library is located in a small town in the USA. The library serves an
approximately number of three thousand members and maintains a collection of twenty thousand
books across its three branches. Recently, there has been an uptick in customer complaints about
books not being available in any of their locations. Thus, the library decided to enlist the
services of Bookworms Consultants Inc to design a book database and reservation system to
improve their operations and customer satisfaction. With this system, members will be able to
reserve books. Each reservation holds the book for only one calendar day, after which it becomes
available for other members unless re-reserved.
